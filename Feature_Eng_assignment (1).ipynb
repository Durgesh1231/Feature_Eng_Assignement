        "# Q1: Filter Method in Feature Selection:\n",
        "# The Filter method is a technique for selecting features based on their statistical properties, independent of any machine learning model.\n",
        "#     - It works by evaluating the relevance of each feature with respect to the target variable, using statistical tests (e.g., chi-square, correlation coefficients, mutual information).\n",
        "#     - Features are ranked according to these criteria, and the top-ranked features are selected for the model.\n",
        "#     - Example: If you have a dataset of customer information, you might use correlation to identify which features, such as age or income, are most strongly related to customer churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q2: Wrapper Method vs. Filter Method in Feature Selection:\n",
        "# The Wrapper method evaluates subsets of features by training a machine learning model and using its performance (e.g., accuracy or F1 score) to select features.\n",
        "#     - It is computationally expensive because it requires training a model on each subset of features.\n",
        "#     - Example: Using a model like logistic regression or decision trees to evaluate different feature subsets and selecting the one with the best performance.\n",
        "# The Filter method, in contrast, evaluates each feature individually without involving any machine learning model and selects based on statistical measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q3: Common Techniques in Embedded Feature Selection:\n",
        "# Embedded methods combine feature selection with the model training process.\n",
        "#     - Techniques include:\n",
        "#         - Lasso (L1 Regularization): Shrinks coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
        "#         - Decision Trees: Can provide feature importance scores based on how well features contribute to reducing impurity (e.g., Gini Index).\n",
        "#         - Random Forests: Can rank features by importance, considering how often they appear in trees and contribute to predictions.\n",
        "#         - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Similar to decision trees, GBM ranks features based on their contribution to the prediction accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q4: Drawbacks of the Filter Method for Feature Selection:\n",
        "# The Filter method has several drawbacks:\n",
        "#     - It does not consider feature interactions, meaning it may miss combinations of features that together are important for the model.\n",
        "#     - It is independent of the model, so it may not lead to optimal performance for the specific model being used.\n",
        "#     - It can be less accurate in high-dimensional spaces where interactions between features are complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q5: Situations for Preferring the Filter Method over the Wrapper Method:\n",
        "# The Filter method is preferred in situations where:\n",
        "#     - There is a large number of features, and computational cost of using the Wrapper method is prohibitive.\n",
        "#     - You want a fast, simple, and model-agnostic approach for feature selection.\n",
        "#     - The relationship between features and the target is relatively simple and can be captured using statistical methods.\n",
        "#     - It helps in reducing dimensionality quickly in high-dimensional datasets.\n",

        "# Q6: Selecting Features using the Filter Method for a Telecom Churn Prediction Project:\n",
        "# For a telecom churn prediction project, I would follow these steps using the Filter method:\n",
        "#     1. Calculate the correlation matrix to assess the relationships between each feature (e.g., customer age, plan type, usage patterns) and the target variable (churn).\n",
        "#     2. Apply statistical tests such as chi-square (for categorical features) or ANOVA (for continuous features) to evaluate feature relevance.\n",
        "#     3. Rank features based on their correlation or statistical significance and select the most relevant ones.\n",
        "#     4. Use domain knowledge to further refine the list of selected features (e.g., customer tenure may be important but might show low correlation in a simple test).\n",

        "# Q7: Using Embedded Method to Select Features for a Soccer Match Outcome Prediction:\n",
        "# For predicting the outcome of a soccer match, I would use the Embedded method as follows:\n",
        "#     1. Train a model like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines on the dataset with all available features (e.g., player statistics, team rankings).\n",
        "#     2. Extract feature importance scores from the model after training, which indicate how much each feature contributes to the prediction.\n",
        "#     3. Rank the features based on importance scores, and select the most relevant features.\n",
        "#     4. Retrain the model using only the selected features and evaluate its performance to ensure the feature selection improves the modelâ€™s predictive power.\n",

        "# For predicting house prices, I would use the Wrapper method to select the best set of features by:\n",
        "#     1. Start by defining a performance metric (e.g., RMSE or MAE).\n",
        "#     2. Use a search algorithm like recursive feature elimination (RFE) to iteratively train a model (e.g., linear regression or decision tree) and evaluate its performance on a validation set.\n",
        "#     3. Evaluate different subsets of features and keep the set that results in the best model performance.\n",
        "#     4. Fine-tune the selected features and retrain the final model for optimal performance on unseen data.\n"
